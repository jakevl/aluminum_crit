Appendix C. Acceptable Chronic Toxicity Data of Aluminum to Freshwater Aquatic Animals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"a LC=Life cycle, ELS=Early life-stage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"b Normalized to pH 7, hardness of 100 mg/L as CaCO3 and DOC of 1 mg/L (see Section 2.7.1). Values in bold are used in SMCV calculation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"c When definitive DOC values were not reported by the authors: a DOC value of 0.5 mg/L was used when dilution water was reconstituted, 1.1 mg/L when dilution water was Lake Superior water, 1.6 mg/L when dilution water was tap or well water, or half the detection limit when the reported value was less than the detection limit, based on recommendations in the 2007 Freshwater Copper AWQC (U.S. EPA 2007b).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"d Buckler et al. (1995) appears to be a republication of McKee et al. (1989), but does not report the most sensitive endpoint and therefore only the most sensitive endpoint used for calculation of the SMCV.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
e DOC was taken from reported values in Cleveland et al. (1989) for a similar pH; all studies are from the same lab and used the same procedures to make the dilution water (well water plus reverse osmosis water mixture).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"f Value is an MATC, poor dose response prevented an EC20 from being calculated; not used in SMCV calculation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
